# 🔥 Forest Fire Prediction

This project focuses on predicting forest fire occurrences using machine learning techniques.  
Built with the **Algerian Forest Fires Processed Dataset**, it applies both **Random Forest** and **Logistic Regression** models to classify and understand fire behavior.

## 📊 Project Overview
The goal of this project is to predict whether a forest fire will occur based on meteorological and environmental factors.  
Comprehensive data analysis and advanced ML techniques were used to improve accuracy and interpretability.

## 🧠 Key Features
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**  
  Visualized dataset distributions, outliers, and trends to understand fire-related patterns.
- **Feature Engineering:**  
  Cleaned and transformed features for optimal model performance.
- **Correlation Heatmap:**  
  Identified strong relationships between variables.
- **Data Balancing (SMOTE):**  
  Handled class imbalance using Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique.
- **Dimensionality Reduction (PCA):**  
  Reduced feature space while preserving important variance.
- **Model Building:**  
  Implemented and compared:
  - 🌲 **Random Forest Classifier**
  - 📈 **Logistic Regression**
- **Explainability (SHAP):**  
  Used SHAP values for interpretable AI, explaining feature importance and individual predictions.
